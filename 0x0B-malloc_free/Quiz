What is malloc and free and how to use them
malloc is used to allocate memory dynamically at runtime. It's prototype is void malloc(size_t). It returns the pointer to the memory block being allocated.

For instance it is forbidden to allocate an unknown variable as the size of an array during declaration but with malloc pointers can be defined that ll take a size which is not predetermined at declaration.
